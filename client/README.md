# Water Cooler

**Water Cooler** is a simple web app that tracks employees that have met each other in the workplace.


## How To Use

Go to the live site at **https://watercoolerapp.herokuapp.com/**. Sign up and sign in. You will create a secret pin that will given out to other employees once they meet you. Likewise, you will receive pin numbers from employees you have met. Input the friend pin with the **Add Friend** button in the navbar. Here is a list of pre-made friend pins to use: charlie, dennis, macmac, deedee, frank, waitress, cricket, billbill, jackjack. Once created, your friends will appear on the screen. Click on the friend card to show more information. That's it!

### Privilege Levels

When you create a new account, your default privilege level will be employee. This will only give you access to the **Add Friend** functionality. 

When signed in as an admin, you will have access to the same functionalities as the employee, and access to the entire list of employees currently signed up. The list can be sorted based on first name, last name, or total number of friends. From the list you can also promote employees to admin status, demote to employee status, or delete an employee from the database.

To sign in as an admin, use:
email: frank@frank.com
password: password
